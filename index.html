  <h1>üåø Understanding Palliative Care: Compassionate Support for Every Step of the Journey</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <section>
    <p>Palliative care is more than just care at the end of life. It is a holistic approach that focuses on comfort, dignity and meaning. This care supports people no matter what stage of illness they are in. Whether you are living with a long-term condition or caring for someone, palliative care can help.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üí° What is Palliative Care?</h2>
    <p>Palliative care is specialised medical care for people living with serious or chronic illness. It aims to relieve pain and manage symptoms. It also offers emotional, spiritual and practical support to patients and families. This care can work alongside treatment that aims to cure or control the illness. It is personalised to reflect your needs, values and wishes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üë• Who Can Benefit?</h2>
    <p>Palliative care can support people of any age who are living with a serious illness such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancer</li>
      <li>Heart failure</li>
      <li>Chronic respiratory conditions</li>
      <li>Neurological conditions such as ALS, Parkinson‚Äôs or stroke</li>
      <li>Kidney or liver disease</li>
      <li>Dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Palliative care is not only for the final stage of illness. The earlier it is introduced, the more support it can offer.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üõ† What Services Are Offered?</h2>
    <p>Palliative care teams often include doctors, nurses, social workers, counsellors and chaplains. They work together to provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pain and symptom management</li>
      <li>Emotional and psychological support</li>
      <li>Spiritual and cultural care</li>
      <li>Support with care planning and decision-making</li>
      <li>Assistance for caregivers and family members</li>
      <li>Care through home visits, hospital services and telehealth options</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The aim is to improve quality of life for the person who is ill and the people who care for them.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">‚è≥ When Should I Consider Palliative Care?</h2>
    <p>Many people think that palliative care is only for the last days of life. This is not true. Palliative care can begin:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At the time of diagnosis</li>
      <li>During active medical treatment</li>
      <li>While receiving rehabilitation</li>
      <li>In residential or long-term care settings</li>
      <li>Alongside hospice care when needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Starting care early can help reduce time in hospital and offer families more time together in comfort and peace.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üîÑ How is Palliative Care Different from Hospice?</h2>
    <p>Palliative care can begin as soon as a serious illness is diagnosed and can continue throughout treatment. Hospice care is a specific type of palliative care. It usually starts when a person is nearing the end of life and no longer seeking curative treatment. Both types of care focus on comfort. However, palliative care is broader and more flexible in when and how it is provided.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="emoji">üí∞ Is It Covered by Insurance?</h2>
    <p>Most palliative care services are covered by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PhilHealth</li>
      <li>Private health insurance</li>
      <li>Medicare and Medicaid</li>
